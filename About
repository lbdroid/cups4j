JfCups is my fork of Cups4j (see http://cups4j.org/) written for use with my 
JfCupsPrint Android applications.

Earlier versions of these applications use a patched version of cups4j but as time
and needs progressed, I've found myself applying more and more patches to cups4j
and eventually decided that this approach with a fork is more appropriate.
